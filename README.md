PRE-REQ:

NFL BIG DATA BOWL DATA VIA KAGGLE
UPLOAD DATA TO GOOGLE CO-LAB

**Summary:**

This code demonstrates how to analyze NFL player data using Python libraries such as pandas, pandasql, and matplotlib. It imports players and tackles data, merges them into a single DataFrame, and then performs various SQL queries to filter and analyze the data.

**Tools Used:**

* Python
* pandas
* pandasql
* matplotlib

**Analysis:**

My focus was on identifying the top tacklers among safeties (SS) in the NFL. It calculates the number of tackles for each safety and then filters the data to only include safeties with at least 31 tackles. Finally, it creates a bar chart to visualize the top tacklers.

**Results:**

The code shows that the top tacklers among safeties are:


* Budda Baker   (80 tackles)
* Eddie Jackson  (74 tackles)
* Richie Grant (69 tackles)

**Conclusion:**

This repo provides a clear and concise way to analyze NFL player data and identify top performers. The use of Python libraries such as pandas, pandasql, and matplotlib makes the data analysis process efficient and straightforward.
